                <p>The Cash Register Manager app is a tool that helps cashiers manage transactions at a retail store or other business. It takes as input the bill amount and the amount of cash provided by the customer, and it calculates the minimum number of notes (such as paper bills or coins) that need to be returned as change. The app displays the result to the cashier, who can then return the appropriate amount of change to the customer. </p>
